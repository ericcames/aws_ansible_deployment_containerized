# Ansible Automation Platform on Amazon Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Build a containerized Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) at Amazon.  You will be able to start using the experimental post install features that come with containerized version of AAP.  Check out the following two git repos for examples on how to build out Ansible Controller and Ansible Private Automation Hub as part of the post install process. This is a repeatable build process for your Ansible Automation Platform.
